ISU Fall 2013 C3DC Anomalies
============================

This repository contains a collection of the Iowa State University Fall 2013 Community College Cyber Defense Competition (C3DC) anomalies and solutions where applicable.  The ISU C3DC anomalies are optional challenges that may be completed by participating teams within the allocated challenge time frame to earn additional points during the competition. Some anomalies are intentionally designed to provoke teams into performing an ill-advised operation that could potentially compromise the security of their network. Other anomalies are simply technical or non-technical challenges designed to engage the participant during the competition in a way that encourages them to learn something new, which may be outside of their expertise or comfort zone.

These anomalies were created for the Iowa State University Fall 2013 Community College Cyber Defense Competition held on December 7, 2013. These anomalies are being released under the MIT License in the hopes that they can be reused or in some way aid in learning or promotion of computer security topics. Ben Holland created this repository.

**Disclaimer:** The brief post-analysis of the C3DC anomalies given below is the work of Ben Holland and does not reflect the views or opinions of Iowa State University.  A best effort was made to collect this data during and after the competition from participant registration, participant check in sheets, the competition scoreboard, and participant feedback.  As a result some of the data and analysis may be subject to errors.  Note also that some of the challenges contain security relevant materials that could be considered malicious by some.  Please use common sense when browsing this and other past anomaly repositories.

## Participation
The ISU Fall 2013 CDC had 15 teams register to compete in the Fall 2013 Community College Cyber Defense Competition.  Before the competition, some teams disbanded and as a result a few teams members were added to the remaining teams leaving 13 participating teams during the competition.

## Anomalies
The competition had a total of 15 anomalies.  For the majority of the competition multiple overlapping anomalies were active for teams to attempt.  Partial credit was given when grading submissions (when applicable).

## Results
The anomalies `Employee Onboarding`, `Add a Service` and `Employee Promotion` were designed to increase the attack surface area of the network and as a result some teams decided to strategically abstain from the challenge.  The `Open Source Software` anomaly was designed to test teams on their ability to sanitize source code and the Red team was given a link to the source repositories created by the Blue teams that completed the challenge.  The remaining challenges were generally beneficial for teams to complete.  Some challenges were much more difficult than others and due to time constraints many teams did not submit all challenges. The `Valentines Day` anomaly contained some hashes that were unlikely to be broken in the challenge time frame and as a result the maximum score earned for the anomaly was 4 out of 10 points.  The `A Ghost in the Wires` anomaly contained two options for completing the challenge, where the easier option resulted in half points being earned.  Only one team completed the harder option of the anomaly.

Similarly to the [ISU Fall Cyber Defense Competition anomalies](https://github.com/benjholla/ISU_Fall_2013_CDC_Anomalies), the size of the team did not seem to affect the team’s ability to solve anomalies.

## Feedback
The `Final Survey` anomaly was used to gather feedback about the competition and each anomaly.  Each team ranked anomalies on a scale of 1 (terrible) to 5 (awesome) concerning enjoyment and difficulty.  Participant feedback for anomalies was mixed.  Negative feedback tended to focus around whether or not the anomalies were appropriate for the Cyber Defense Competition (“IT based” challenges Vs. "gimmicky" or “cryptography” puzzles).  Other negative feedback tended to mention the lack of manpower to complete the anomalies (although the data in the previous section doesn't necessarily support this sentiment).
