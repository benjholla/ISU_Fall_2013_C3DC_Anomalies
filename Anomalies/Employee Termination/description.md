# Employee Termination## Jeff is Getting FiredJeff has been obsesivly checking his Facebook during work hours.  In fact, I don't think he has done anything except update his Facebook status all week.  We warned him, and now he's getting fired in the next half hour.  ## ChallengeWe would like you to diable all of Jeff's accounts.  He might be someone to hold a grudge.  Completing this anomaly will earn you [10 points].
