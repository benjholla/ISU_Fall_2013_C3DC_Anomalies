# Solution

Calling the number given in the challenge plays the message:

>  Hello. Nobody is available to take your message, please hang up and...hawhaw Almost got you. My name is Marvin the snark bot.  You've called the pirate treasure hotline.  If you want some treasure, you'll have to work for it. I'm thinking of a pay-phone.  It's on the third floor of, Coover Hall.  Go there, and then call me back from that phone for the next set of instructions.  Goodbye.

Calling the Coover 3rd Floor pay-phone plays the next message:

>  Shall we play a game? How about a nice game of Global Thermonuclear War...Oh...Your not the Professor, you are that kid I sent on a fool's errand to that pay-phone.  I'll need you to go to a different pay-phone and call me back.  I want you to call from a free public phone located in the Parks Library.  Goodbye.

Calling from the public phone in the Parks Library plays the next message:

>  Oh hey...It's you again...You are very persistent.  I'm making a note here, huge success.  It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.  Are you ready for a challenge?  Go to the Durham Center building and call me from the pay-phone in the lobby.  Goodbye.

There are two pay-phones in Durham (calling the wrong one tells the participant to call the one to the right.)  The correct pay-phone in Durham plays the message:

>  Good job.  I forgot to mention there were two phones in the lobby...sorry.  That won't happen again.  Go to the Union Drive Community Center and call me from that pay-phone.  Also there will be cake.  Goodbye.

This time there are three phones.  The correct phone is the phone on the farthest left.  Hints are given if the wrong phone is chosen.  Calling from the correct phone plays the message:

>  Hello again.  I guess you found out that the cake was a lie...sorry.  Anyway, do you still want your pirate treasure?  Go to the second floor in the Nuclear Engineering building.  There is a Wifi Network called "Piratebox - Share Freely".  Join the network, and then open a web browser to the page, pirate.lan.  Open the shared text file called, pirate_booty_treasure.txt.  Submit the code inside on IScore to complete this challenge.  Goodbye.  It has been a pleasure...sort of.

The PirateBox WiFi contains the text file `pirate_booty_treasure.txt` which contains:

>  The code is: "I HATE EXERCISE".
