# [Where in the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bjAfVLk80g) is Satoshi Nakamoto?## BackgroundAre you a [Bitcoin Barron](https://soundcloud.com/ytcracker/ytcracker-bitcoin-baron-v1-ssl) scaring the status quo?  Do you drink all the booze and [hack all the things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoUWHfh733Y)?  In late 2008, a paper called [Bitcoin : A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](./bitcoin.pdf) was published on an obscure crypto forum.  While the idea persisted and eventually took off, we still don't know the identity of the mysterious author of our crazed crypto-currency.> There are no records of Nakamoto's identity or identities prior to the creation of Bitcoin. On his P2P foundation profile, Nakamoto claimed to be an individual male at the age of 37 and living in Japan, which was met with great skepticism due to his use of English and his Bitcoin software not being documented nor labeled in Japanese.    > British formatting in his written work implies Nakamoto is of British origin. However, he also sometimes used American spelling, which may indicate that he was intentionally trying (but failed) to mask his writing style, or that he is more than one person.    > The first release of his original Bitcoin software is speculated to be of a collaborative effort, leading some to claim that Satoshi Nakamoto was a collective pseudonym for a group of people.        Reference: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto    There have been [several attempts](./SATOSHI_large.jpg) to uncover the identity of the person or persons behind Bitcoin with no success to date.  Nevertheless the [value of Bitcoins](https://www.mtgox.com/) is steadily rising.  Regardless of who Satoshi Nakamoto is or is not, a lot of people are eager to get in on the action.  One way to earn Bitcoins is to mine them by computing hashes.## QuestionsPlease attempt to answer all questions below.
