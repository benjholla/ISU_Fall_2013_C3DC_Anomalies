# File Recovery
Someone got the bright idea to remove all the file extensions on some files in our network share, for you know...security?.  We fired him this morning.

Anyway, can you figure the file extensions of each file?  You will earn [2 points] for each correct file type identification.  If the file type is ambiguous for some reason, provide justification for your answer.
