# Valentine's Day

## Background
Valentine's Day is coming up just around the corner (Feb. 14th).  Your [girlfriend is a hacker (best hacker ever)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzgquM7NQIc).  One day she just [SSH'd into your heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeqHYzuB7DE).  Your boss must have been reading something about the [West Coast Tech Culture](http://theoatmeal.com/pl/minor_differences5/suit) lately, because this morning he said you can spend a bit of your time today working on whatever you'd like.  

When you're as l33t as your girlfriend, owning machines gets to be a bit tedious.  It's the little things that get you, like sifting through the piles of stolen data you have.  With the help of an unfortunate network admin and your [Rubber-hose Cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis) skillz, you managed to uncover a shadow file to a system on your GF's hit list.

## Challenge

Crack as many of the passwords as you can in this shadow file.  This challenge is worth [10 points].  You will receive 1 point for each password correctly recovered.
