# A Strange Message

## Background
Someone found something strange in the logs for the shell server. It looks like someone failed to ssh in 20+ times in one day. The really interesting part is the "attacker's" IP address is the shell server's own IP. What's going on here?

## Challenge
We're not really sure what to make of this. We would like your opinion on whether this is an attack or not. If it isn't an attack, then what could it be?
