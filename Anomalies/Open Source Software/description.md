# Open-source Software

## Background
The CDC Intranet web app was running on Rails last we checked.  [Rails Is Omakase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E99FnoYqoII).  Open-source software (OSS) is secure right?  We've made some changes to the Intranet site and we'd like to push our changes back to the [Github repo it came from](https://github.com/zach-taylor/cdc-intranet).

## Challenge

Go to [https://github.com/zach-taylor/cdc-intranet](https://github.com/zach-taylor/cdc-intranet), fork the project, and push a commit of your changes to your forked project. Make sure you actually push your changes, you will not receive points if your changes are not in the repo!

Submit a link to your fork in IScore.
